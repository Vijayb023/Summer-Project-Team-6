# Summer-Project-Team-6
Software Engineering Project

Introduction

      	Our idea is to create a Web-App that will help facilitate the large increase of demand in the sports betting market. Our app will have the capabilities to give live feed updates of games, season history, player history, and live updates of odds. Our minimum viable product will only focus on soccer games from the Champions League.
After users enter our site, they will be directed to setup an account. Users will create login credentials and payment info which will be encoded to the database. Users will be able to navigate through the sites after account verification. Users can then view data such as live game scores and stats though our live game-feed feature. The data will be available through the API-Football service. It is an API which gives 100 requests for free a month to users. It contains all the data we need in JSON format. Users will be able to deposit funds into their accounts to make bets.

Technologies

   	Our client-side will be using the React framework which encompasses aspects of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. There could potentially be some PHP for database connection. On the server side we will run the react app on a node server and separately run the APIs on a Django or Flask framework. Our database will be a flavor of MySQL, preferably MariaDB. The app will deploy on Heroku.
